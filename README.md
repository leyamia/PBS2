# PBS2
Implementation of C++ forward iterators to generate the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming. 
**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic programming
- Linear time Fibonacci calculation
- Constant space usage
- Infinite sequence generation (up to 64-bit integer limits)
- Iterator encapsulation and composition
- Controlled iteration using `begin()` and `end()`
- Satisfies a custom `BasicForwardIterator` concept

⚙️ Compilation Make sure your compiler supports C++20.
